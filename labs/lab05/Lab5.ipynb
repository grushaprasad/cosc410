    "In class I made the following claims: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A single layer perceptron (i.e., a logistic regression model) can never learn the XOR function because the data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "* A feedforward NN with just an additional hidden layer with non-linear activation can learn the XOR function.\n",
    "* A feedforward NN where all the activation functions are linear cannot learn the XOR function if the hidden layer (or layers) have a linear activation function. \n",

    "The goal in this part is for you to convince yourself of these claims. To do this, you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to train a single layer perceptron on the XOR task with different hyperparameters and epochs. Based on your experiments, make an argument why you think the model cannot learn the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build an FNN with an additional hidden layer and a non-linear activation function. You can find documentation about activation functions in Pytorch [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is there at least one non-linear activation function you find that helps the model learn the task? Are there non-linear activation functions listed in the documentation that do not work? How does the number of epochs and the type of training (batch vs. mini-batch vs. stochastic) impact learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build a modified version of your FNN with the non-linear activation function removed. Try to train this model with different hyperparameters and epochs. Based on your experiments, make an argument why you think the model cannot learn the function.\n",
