# HW4: Benchmarks

### COSC 410B: Spring 2025, Colgate University

## Instructions

In this homework write a **2 to 3 page document** that engages with the benchmark your group discussed in class.  

#### What to submit
A pdf document that answers all of the questions below. 


## Questions

#### Summarizing the benchmark

* What is the goal of the benchmark? What type of knowledge/ performance is it trying to target?

* What is the task? What are the inputs and outputs?

* What does success on the benchmark look like? What is the ceiling? What is the random baseline? What is human performance (if relevant)? 


#### Model performance on the benchmark

* Which model currently has state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark? 

* How does this differ from the models that authors originally used in the paper introducing the benchmark (either in model type or performance)? 

* Why might these changes have resulted in an improvement in performance on the benchmark? 


#### Interpreting success on the benchmark

* At what model performance would you consider the benchmark to be “solved”?

* If a model achieves this performance, then do you think the model has mastery over the knowledge or capability that the benchmark was targeting? Why or why not?
